Setting: Hybrid Environment
User Mailboxes are Migrated to Exchange Online.
Everything is Working except the booking of rroms etc.
The reason is that The Mailbox Flag ProcessExternalMeetingMessages is set to false.
After Settings the flag to true Bookings are working as expected.

To check if the flag is set to false:
Get-CalendarProcessing MettingRoom | FL *

To set the flag:
Set-CalendarProcessing MettingRoom -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $true

After the Migration:
You should Disable the Flag after the Migration was successfull
Otherwise Bookingsmessages from External are possible ( forever )
